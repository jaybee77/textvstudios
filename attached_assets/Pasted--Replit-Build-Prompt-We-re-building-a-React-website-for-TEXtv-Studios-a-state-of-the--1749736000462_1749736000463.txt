## üöÄ Replit Build Prompt

We're building a **React website** for **TEXtv Studios**, a state-of-the-art recording facility featuring three distinct studio environments: a traditional recording studio, a podcast studio, and a broadcast control room. The site should showcase these offerings in a clean, professional layout using **Tailwind CSS** for styling.  

The goal is to:
- Clearly describe each studio type and pricing
- Allow users to visit an external booking page
- Display a media gallery (placeholders for now)
- Provide company info and a contact form

The design should emphasize **modern simplicity**, ease of navigation, and mobile responsiveness.

## ‚úÖ Tailwind Setup Notes

Make sure to install Tailwind using the official guide: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app  
Use utility classes for spacing, layout, responsiveness, and hover states.

Example button:

```html
<button className="bg-black text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-800 transition">
  Book a Session
</button>
```

---

Let me know if you want a dark theme toggle, sticky navbar, or animations (e.g. Framer Motion). This structure is good to go for Replit or local React builds.
